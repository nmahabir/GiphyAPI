# GiphyAPI
# Created this App using Jquery and Javascript

# The user can add animal buttons by clicking on the search button after typing in an animal type.

# The user is able to click on the Gif's and then if there is a still state available in the object, the animal gif turns to still state, the user will then have to reclick the Gif in order for it to turn back to the animate state.

# Enjoy!
